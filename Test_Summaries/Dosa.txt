Dish: Dosa
Summary: 1. Soak 2 parts rice and 1 part urad dal (split black gram) with a few fenugreek seeds for 4–6 hours. Grind to a smooth batter with water and let it ferment overnight or for 8–12 hours until airy and slightly risen.
2. Stir the fermented batter and add salt. Heat a non-stick or cast-iron tawa, pour a ladle of batter in the center, and spread it out in a circular motion. Drizzle a little oil or ghee around the edges.
3. Cook until the bottom is golden and crispy. Fold and serve hot with coconut chutney and sambar. Optionally, fill with spiced potato masala for masala dosa.
