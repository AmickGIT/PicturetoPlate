Dish: Dosa
Summary: 1. Preheat a nonstick or cast-iron griddle over medium heat and brush lightly with oil or ghee.
2. Pour a ladleful of batter onto the center and quickly spread in a spiral to form a thin crepe. Drizzle oil/ghee around edges and cook until the bottom is golden and crisp.
3. Flip briefly (or fold without flipping), transfer to a plate, and serve hot with coconut chutney, tomato chutney, and sambar.
