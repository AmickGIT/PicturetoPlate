Dish: Fried Rice
Summary: 1. Heat a little oil in a wok, add beaten eggs (or lightly sauté veggies), scramble until just set, then transfer to a bowl.
2. In the same wok, sauté minced garlic, ginger, and white parts of green onions. Add rice, break up clumps, and stir-fry until hot.
3. Return eggs/veg to the wok, splash in soy sauce and a drizzle of sesame oil, toss to coat, then garnish with green onion tops and serve.
