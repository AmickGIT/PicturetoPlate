1. Cook and cool rice (preferably a day old). Chop vegetables like carrots, beans, capsicum, and spring onions. Beat 1–2 eggs if using, and keep soy sauce, vinegar, and pepper ready.
2. Heat oil in a wok or pan. Scramble the eggs (if using) and set aside. Sauté garlic, then add chopped veggies and stir-fry on high heat until just cooked. Add the eggs back in.
3. Add the rice, soy sauce, vinegar, salt, and pepper. Toss everything on high heat for a few minutes until well combined and heated through.
