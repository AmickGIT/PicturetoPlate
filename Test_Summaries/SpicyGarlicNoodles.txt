Dish: Spicy Garlic Noodles
Summary: 1. Boil noodles until just done, drain and toss with a little oil to prevent sticking.
2. In a hot wok, stir-fry minced garlic, ginger, and chili until fragrant (watch the garlic so it doesnâ€™t burn).
3. Add noodles back in, splash with soy sauce and vinegar or lime, toss thoroughly, then garnish with sliced green onions and sesame seeds before serving.
