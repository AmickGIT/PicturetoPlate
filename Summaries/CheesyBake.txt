Dish: Cheesy Bake
Summary: 1. Boil or steam your choice of veggies (e.g., broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, corn) or cooked pasta/chicken. Lightly season with salt, pepper, and herbs.
2. In a pan, melt butter, add flour, and cook for a minute. Slowly whisk in milk to make a smooth white sauce. Add grated cheese (like cheddar or mozzarella) and stir until melted and creamy.
3. Mix the base with the cheese sauce, pour into a greased baking dish, top with more cheese, and bake at 180°C (350°F) for 20–25 minutes until golden and bubbly. Serve hot!
