Dish: Mustard Fish
Summary: 1. Clean and slice the fish. Soak mustard seeds for 2 hours, then grind with salt and green chillies to a paste. Mix in grated coconut, yoghurt, sugar, turmeric, and mustard oil to make a marinade.
2. Coat the fish pieces with the mixture, place them in a tiffin box with halved green chillies on top, fasten the lid, and marinate for at least 15 minutes.
3. Steam the sealed tiffin in a covered pan with hot water for 15 minutes. Let it rest for 5 minutes before serving.
