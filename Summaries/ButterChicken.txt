Dish: Butter Chicken
Summary: 1. Marinate boneless chicken pieces in yogurt, lemon juice, ginger-garlic paste, chili powder, and garam masala for at least 1 hour. Then grill, bake, or pan-fry until cooked and slightly charred.
2. In a pan, heat butter and sauté ginger, garlic, and tomatoes until soft. Blend this into a smooth puree, then return to the pan and add cream, kasuri methi (dried fenugreek), chili powder, and salt. Simmer until rich and creamy.
3. Add the cooked chicken to the sauce, simmer for 10–15 minutes, adjust seasoning, and serve hot with naan or rice.
